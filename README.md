 twitch.tv Bot Dashboard

This is my personal favorite project.

This is a revamp of a previous project I had worked on.
The previous version was an Electron React dashboard running a twitch bot in the background using electrons main process.

The end user could make selections of the settings they wanted the bot to utilize and the bot would change respectively.
I had made that program with a single user in mind and found rather quickly it would be a very usefull program for others to have.

I am not working on a website deployment of said program now. This front-end project will eventually connect to a backend Node Twitch bot.
The bot will communicate with a MongoDB Atlas deployment or a Railyway postgres server. I have yet to decide on final deployment.

I believe Railway will be better for performance but not sure I would like to pay for anything if it is not a profitable program.

The frontend will allow sign in through twitch account so the owner of the account can make changes to the bot and edit chat messages as the streamer
can on the twitch dashbord built into the streaming site. I hope to add much more functionality but also incorporate the standard twitch features.

This should result in a seamless transition for new users and a large amount of customizability for the advanced users.
